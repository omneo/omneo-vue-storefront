# About

The Omneo Vue Storefront integration is designed to operate on top of your primary ecommerce integration with Vue Storefront.
Omneo can link customers using an external eCommerce application customer id. 
Doing this allows your front end to enrich the existing platforms customer data, with Omneo data.

Omneo uses the Omneo ID Proxy to interact with the [Omneo API](https://omneo.readme.io/reference)
Through which developers can request a single user access token using the appropriate eCommerce ID (such as Shopify)
The front end then access the Omneo API using the single profiles context.
